# Steps for using the verification branch #

- Make a pull request to the Verification branch(from your branch)
- Merge all conflicts using visual studio
- Make sure you make an alert on disord that you have merged your branch

- If you are the last person to merge into Verification, make a pull request from master for the final merge to master
- DO NOT merge into master, that will be the job of Casey as a reviewer
